		From thingmaker.
		<h3>Early days of thingmaker's website</h3>
		The website started as many files and folders on a old computer at somewhere between late 2020 to early 2021.
		At this time, it was not accessible from the internet as it was local files.
		This was also when thingmaker started adding things to MineKhan.
		Some time before December 2020, he downloaded a version of MineKhan (0.7.1) originaly from some time before <a href="https://github.com/Willard21/MineKhan/tree/dc6f22381138c4e01799ec107bfb02e2bdc5033c">this</a>.
		The first things added to it were textures and new blocks called 'soup'.
		Later adding redstone was tried, by adding on and off blocks, then a block called 'buffer' was added which was supposed to behave like a redstone repeater.
		The redstone blocks didn't work well but stayed.
		Some time, later, cows and pigs were added which move in random directions and looked bad.
		Starting near April 2021, thingmaker checked the profile of RedMonster (https://www.khanacademy.org/profile/monsterred/projects) frequently for new things to add to the version of MineKhan.
		
		On May 8 2021, the version of MineKhan with changes by thingmaker was uploaded to R____t.
		A few days later, on May 12 2021, the website was also moved onto R____t (https://replit.com/@thingMaker/www) and became accessible from the internet.
		The website was still very basic.
		Soon, on May 24 2021, a server (https://replit.com/@thingMaker/server) was made for the website.
		A simple login were added to the website and server.
		The code for the login was copied from somewhere else because thingmaker did not know how to make a login at that time.
		Websockets were also experimented with because they would allow adding multiplayer to thingmaker's version of MineKhan.
		In May 2021, multiplayer was added to the version of MineKhan.
		Posts and comments on posts was added to the server and website.
		Posts were a part of the website where people could post text.
		Then, the first post not by thingmaker appeared. (name: Hello, by: Spider, content: Hello)
		After some time, there were more new users, including: Roger999, sup6666, MyHat3, Pillow1007

		In June 2021, profile pictures were added to the website and server.
		Notifications were also added and a way to ban in MineKhan was added to the server.
		Live comments were also added to posts.
		You can also see list of updates <a href="/minekhan/updates.txt">here</a> and old versions <a href="/minekhan/history">here</a>.
		This was also when nether terrain was updated in the version of MineKhan.
		<img src="/assets/images/n.png" loading="lazy">
		New users at this time: RedMonster12, weqwef (aka Guineapigbridge and SpiderScript), Magic4792
		New users near this time: Brenda_Puckle

		In July 2021, RedMonster12 began suggesting blocks to add to MineKhan and uploaded many textures.
		After sideways torches were added to thingmaker's version of MineKhan, it was updated to 1.0.3.
		<a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/doooij2qr/image/upload/v1626571425/1626571424328.png">image</a>

		In August 2021, Luke started to add pistons to his copy of thingmaker's version of MineKhan.
		New users near this time: multibuilder, novacoding, SpaceSoldier (other usernames: SpaceSoldier248), TayyabR, Aussie Audra

		September 2021, image:
		<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/doooij2qr/image/upload/v1631663065/1631663065104.png" loading="lazy">
		New users: CrackersthehackerYT

		In October 2021, panoramas were added to the version of MineKhan and it was updated to 1.0.4.
		<a href="/minekhan/assets/images/panorama/p.png">image</a>
		At this time, thingmaker made a post about maps for halloween.
		The scarecrow was used for the panorama.
		New users: HB_the_Pencil, SomeBoyPlayz (goldenPvP on yt), Adith
		<a href="/minekhan/assets/images/panorama/halloween_2021.png">image</a>
		Then, in November 2021, the player model in the version of MineKhan was updated and changing skins was added.
		New users: Jay2021, Loco, Ironbrodiet

		<h3>The website for MineKhan</h3>
		Near December 2021, TNJS (https://replit.com/@tnjs) invited thingmaker to help make a website.
		The idea was to create a website where people could upload MineKhan maps to share and download them.
		It was likely that someone told him to ask thingmaker to help create the website for MineKhan maps.
		So, the website for MineKhan was created by thingmaker and TNJS.
		The first things added were a way to upload maps.
		A few weeks later, push notifications were added.
		Anyone who subscribed would get a notification when a new map was uploaded.
		Image from this time:
		<img src="/assets/images/survival in jungle december 23 2021.jpg" loading="lazy">
		New users at this time: goatedkiller, TEXAN7, Candy (possibly wrong time), finn, ThrustBacon, ratrodford1, Therealmushroom

		New users near this time: Butter (other usernames: Am_Butter, Sharky), Entity_303, Mrbeast

		In Janurary 2022, an update for redstone had started.
		After a few days, the server also started to run out of space for users and posts.
		New users: Trexler180 (other usernames: Trexler), Prytor, Kiro_sama, Zenith
		So in Feburary 2022, they were moved to a different place. (r____t db to level db)
		At this time, on Feburary 18, the version of MineKhan was getting very popular and there were many worlds in multiplayer at the same time, so a limit of 5 worlds at the same time was added.
		New users: repeat
		In March 2022, there was an idea to create a wiki for MineKhan on the website for MineKhan.
		So the wiki for MineKhan was created, and it looked really bad at first.
		On April 1, 2022, the redstone update for the version of MineKhan was released and it was updated to 1.0.5.
		<a href="/minekhan/assets/images/panorama/redstone_april-2022.png">image</a>
		On April 14, 2022, thingmaker started to create the first external server for the version of MineKhan, which was called 'Test server'. (https://replit.com/@MineKhan/mkServer)
		External servers were a way to host a world for the version of MineKhan where the world stayed open almost all the time and the world could be controlled with code.
		At first, this external server did not have a world, instead, when joining, it asked for a suggestion for the name.
		Then, on April 18, a world save code was added, and on April 19, portals (teleports to another room) were added.
		The code for external servers was still bad and it was easy to cheat. (flying, getting any item)
		New users in April 2022: shubbleYT, eaglermaster (other usernames: Eaglemasterussr), Fire_Fox, sadlyitsnotme, AXL_SENSEI
		On May 3 2022, whitelist was added to the version of MineKhan and the server.
		Capes and cloud saves for MineKhan were also added.

		<details><summary>mysterious hacks</summary><p>A user who's username was like y__f, and also had a previous username that contained 'piano' in it, appeared near this time. This user used something that was called 'karmaclient', which was like a bot, to run commands in the version of MineKhan like '.troll username' or '.crash'. Unfortunately, this user disappeared after a few days and no other information was found by thingmaker.</p></details>
		Unfortunately, the popularity decreased a lot in the summer, but multiplayer worlds in the version of MineKhan was still common.
		In June 2022, multiplayer in the version of MineKhan stopped working.
		The server for the website for MineKhan ran out of space, which happened faster than normal, and stopped working.
		At this time, thingmaker was away for about a week and did not know about it, and some people thought he couldn't fix it.
		There was a post called 'Admin vote'.
		On June 25, the code for external servers were moved. (to https://www.npmjs.com/package/minekhan-server)
		On June 27, a room with creative mode was added to the Test server.
		A external server called 'War SMP' was also created.
		On June 28, a lobby was added, then bedwars was added, which had 4 islands and a wait for 4 players and a win when a bed was broken. It was not very good quality because there was flat layer of grass underneath.
		New users: ILikeCheese
		New users near this time: Speedy5, springyeet

		In July 2022, there were many accounts on the server that were unused, so many of these were deleted.
		On July 6, a external server called 'Dope SMP' was created.
		New users: HackySacks
		On July 27, flowing water and lava was added to the version of MineKhan.
		On the last day of July, the users and posts and other things were moved again. (level db to cloud storage)

		August 2022:
		On August 1, an external server called "Luke's Server" was created, which had a survival anarchy and a game called 'The Pit' where players fight and get to the top of a tower.
		On August 8, claiming chunks was added to the Test server.
		There were more external servers: one by Paragram (forgot name), Epixel, one by RedMonster12.
		Images of 'Test server':

		<img src="/assets/images/What the... aug 20 2022.jpeg" loading="lazy">
		During August and September, more redstone things were added to the version of MineKhan.
		August 2022, new users: gouling, Raeshawna, Paragram, I, TomMustBe12
		In September 2022, TomMustBe12 started sending emails to thingmaker about making him admin or hacking the version of MineKhan.
		September 2022, new users: Thunder_Wolf, perX, Express
		On September 7, posts were made to load faster.
		On September 22, a option for disabling filter for chat was added to the version of MineKhan and the server.
    <img src="/assets/images/Screen Shot 2022-09-02 at 8.31.12 PM.jpg" loading="lazy">

		October 2022:
		On October 2, comments were added to user profiles.
		Later in October, thingmaker decided to combine the website and the server with the new website for MineKhan. (https://replit.com/@minekhan/MineKhan)
		The maps and wiki pages were also moved to the place where the users and posts were.
		The home page of thingmaker's website and the website for MineKhan were also combined, and the website was renamed.
		This was also when TomMustBe12 created the form, 'Admin for MineKhan'. (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/19w9xtnu1rh1NEWQsQ4LErVo2DCyAbUx_I6bO2AmocgE)
		<details><p>Another thing that happened was that Spa<span>mmer17 (probably same person as su<span>p6</span>666) sayed that they would make the website g</span>one if not give admin.</p></details>

		After some time, in November 2022, saving previous version of wiki pages was added to the website for MineKhan.
		New users: rayLee
		On November 27, a game mode called 'chaos' was added to the Test server. It was a game mode where lava falls from the sky.
		At the end of November, external servers for MineKhan were updated to be faster by making it connect directly. (it was like that when external servers were first added)

		<datails><summary>Another 'hacked' client</summary><p>In December 2022, TomMustBe12 created something like a plugin that allowed people to cheat. (https://replit.com/@awhatcott/KhaHack) It seemed that only a few people used it.</p></datails>
		December 2022, new users: Micro_Wave, jennanoelhupp

		Janurary 2023, new users: Caterpillar_fan, Light_FN, 2bHNSTi (possibly wrong time)

		Feburary 2023
		<details><p>rayLee sayed that they would <span>take away the website and b<span>an thing</span>maker from the website if not gi</span>ven admin.</p></details>
		On Feburary 3, features.js was added to the version of MineKhan.
		It was a script that had a 1 in 1000 chance of running, that would randomly show the message 'it will be gone' and run randomly generated commands.

		As March 2023 began, the website was about to be moved again because the website started to stop working and R____t's free hosting was going to end in 2024.
		The console of the server was filled messages of socket hang up or something similar.
		At this time, resource packs had also been added to the version of MineKhan.
		Finally, after a month, the website was moved. (to thingmaker.us.eu.org)
		TNJS did not go to the new website.

		<h3>Website change</h3>
		After the website was moved, the website started working again and became faster.
		The website was renamed back to 'My website'.
		At this time, the website popularity had decreased more.
		In April 2023, many things were added to the version MineKhan, including hardcore mode, double sided signs, and more.
		New users: MouseMan (other usernames: MouseMania, MouseManiaAlt), Szable, Maly_Byk (other username like: Peq???Toro), King_kye

		May 2023, new users: CubeX_, Silver_

		In June 2023, more things were added (cherry and bamboo).
		At this time, thingmaker started to create new terrain for the version of MineKhan.
		Many months was used to do this.
		New users: cheezit_sauce, StinkinChicken, incognito, scuffed, MonocleCat

		July 2023, new users: Mythical_Sweetz

		August 2023, new users: likofring_exe

		In October 2023, the version of MineKhan was updated to 1.1.0, and the new terrain was added.
		<a href="/minekhan/assets/images/panorama/beta-1.0.0-oct-29-2023.png">image</a>
		Multiplayer was also changed to make cheating harder.
		New users: sus12
		Many more months were used to improve the terrain in the version of MineKhan because thingmaker did not think it was good enough.

		In March 2024, the version of MineKhan was updated to 1.1.1, which made cheating even harder.
		At this time, There were about 30 users per day. (there may have been more that were not logged in)
		Soon thingmaker's version of MineKhan was discontinued, because the amount of players had decreased a lot.
