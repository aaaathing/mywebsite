		<h3>Early days of thingmaker's website</h3>
		The website started as many files and folders on a old computer at somewhere between late 2020 to early 2021.
		At this time, it was not accessible from the internet as it was local files.
		The home page and nav bar were copied from w3schools, and the home page showed your programs and webpages.
		There was a code editor where you could make programs and webpages, which was inspired by KA.
		
		This was also when thingmaker started adding things to MineKhan.
		Some time before December 2020, he downloaded a version of MineKhan (0.7.1) originaly from some time before <a href="https://github.com/Willard21/MineKhan/tree/dc6f22381138c4e01799ec107bfb02e2bdc5033c">this</a>.
		The first thing added was tnt block, which was already in the code.
		Then portal blocks and obsidian were added, which probably did not do anything.
		The portal blocks textures copied from another spin-off.
		<img src="/assets/images/portal thing December 18 2020 7.15 PM copy.jpg" loading="lazy">
		Later adding redstone was tried, by adding on and off blocks, then a block called 'buffer' was added which was supposed to behave like a redstone repeater.
		The redstone blocks didn't work well because it caused errors often, but it stayed.
		Then textures and new blocks called 'soup' were added to it.
		At these times, thingmaker often searched for new MineKhan spin-offs to copy things from.
		Some of the things copied from the spin-offs were fall damage and island world type and biomes (desert and field).
		Starting near April 2021, thingmaker checked the profile of RedMonster (https://www.khanacademy.org/profile/monsterred/projects) frequently for new things to add to the version of MineKhan.
		Some of those things were flowers, doors, lanterns, cactus.
		Some time later, cows and pigs were added which move in random directions and looked bad.

		On May 8 2021, the version of MineKhan with changes by thingmaker was uploaded to R____t.
		A few days later, on May 12 2021, the website was also moved onto R____t (https://replit.com/@thingMaker/www) and became accessible from the internet.
		The website was still very basic.
		Then, thingmaker wanted to add a login to the website, which was also probably inspired by KA.
		So it was added and you could change your username and the username showed on the nav bar.
		On May 24 2021, a server (https://replit.com/@thingMaker/server) was made for the website.
		A simple login were added to the website and server.
		The code for the login was copied from somewhere else because thingmaker did not know how to make a login at that time.
		Websockets were also experimented with because they would allow adding multiplayer to thingmaker's version of MineKhan.
		In May 2021, multiplayer was added to the version of MineKhan.
		Posts and comments on posts was added to the server and website.
		Posts were a part of the website where people could post text.
		Then, the first post not by thingmaker appeared. (name: Hello, by: Spider, content: Hello)
		<details><p>Some time near this time, thingmaker tried to add breaking blocks in survival mode to the version of MineKhan. The time for breaking grass and dirt was added, which was very fast. Then, adding crack texture was tried. At first, the block textures got messed up. After some time, the crack texture showed up almost correctly because it had z-fighting. It was left like that.</p></details>
		New users near this time: Spider, sup6666, MyHat3, Pillow1007

		In June 2021, profile pictures were added to the website and server.
		Notifications were also added and a way to ban in MineKhan was added to the server.
		Live comments were also added to posts.
		A few sounds including grass sound and stone sound were added to the version of MineKhan.
		On June 10, RedMonster added many more sounds to a fork (https://replit.com/@RedMonster12/minekhan-update) of the version of MineKhan.
		<img src="/assets/images/Screenshot 2024-09-09 at 9.39.24 AM.jpg" loading="lazy">
		<details><p>One time, I had a world called "House" which was superflat and contained a large house made of quartz, and turned on multiplayer for it. Then, Roger999 joined and there was a very loud sound which was caused by setting many blocks, so he said something like "ow my ears". Some further details lost. Some time later, I saw that someone else had a copy of the world, with multiplayer on, and people (probably including Brenda_Puckle) were improving it, so i deleted the original one which was a mistake. In the copied world, i probably built a toilet and saw other people (probably Roger999) doing things with spruce doors.</p></details>
		<details><p>Another time, I joined a world which was hosted by someone that was either netherBuilder or destiny6. They were building a big building like a fortess in the nether. This was when the nether had small hills but no overhangs, before it was updated. Some time after joining, i saw that they were building a floor manually (probably made of glowstone), and i wanted to help them build it faster, so i used commands (/fromPlayer /fillToPlayer).</p></details>
		<details><p>Another time, I joined a world which was hosted by sup6666. It was normal world type and had a house in a cave with pillars, which i also might have built a toilet in, and other stuff. Then, Pillow1007 joined and i thought that he rarely join even though he was one of the first, after a few minutes, Pillow1007 left. Later, when joining again, the world type became island world type, which was a bug. The house with stairs and other people were floating above the water.</p></details>
		<details><p>Another time, I was in a world hosted by MyHat3. He was building the walls of something big. Then, it froze. After a while, it unfroze and all the things that happened when it froze happened very quickly, including him moving around. I thought that it was probably lag.</p></details>
		<detials><p>Another time, I was hosting a world which was normal world type. Then netherBuilder joined. I might have asked why there were floating branches but no jungle trees. He probably said that it was using setBlock instead of spawnBlock. I thought that it was surprising that he knew about it. (a year later, i found similarities with netherBuilder and sup6666). I looked at the code for generating jungle trees and saw that it was using setBlock but still could not figure out why the branches were floating.</p></detials>
		This was also when nether terrain was updated in the version of MineKhan.

		New users at this time: Roger999, RedMonster12, weqwef (aka Guineapigbridge and SpiderScript), Magic4792
		New users near this time: Brenda_Puckle

		In July 2021, RedMonster12 began suggesting blocks to add to MineKhan and uploaded many textures.
		After sideways torches were added to thingmaker's version of MineKhan, it was updated to 1.0.3.

		In August 2021, Luke started to add pistons to his copy of thingmaker's version of MineKhan. (https://replit.com/@LukeP0WERS/MineKhan-testing)
		New users near this time: novacoding
		New users at this time: Luke, multibuilder, SpaceSoldier (other usernames: SpaceSoldier248), TayyabR, Aussie Audra
		<details><p>One day near this time, in a world in the version of MineKhan, Luke asked me if he could help develop MineKhan. I told him that there were about 30K lines of code. He might have sayed something like "wow".</p></details>

		<details><p>One day, Aussie Audra was hosting a survival world. It was using the default seed (which most worlds did), and there was snow at the spawn. I was probably surprised because Aussie Audra usually stayed on willard.fun. I might have built a house in the snowy area in the world. Later, i was in a cave near the snowy area, and probably had an iron pickaxe, then the server probably closed. After rejoining, the inventory was reset to empty. I thought that it was annoying, so I decided to make inventory save in multiplayer. Afterwards, I probably did not see Aussie Audra on this version of MineKhan again.</p></details>

		In October 2021, panoramas were added to the version of MineKhan and it was updated to 1.0.4.
		<a href="/minekhan/assets/images/panorama/p.png">image</a>
		At this time, thingmaker made a post about maps for halloween.
		The scarecrow was used for the panorama.

		Then, in November 2021, the player model in the version of MineKhan was updated and changing skins was added.
		<details><p>Soon after updating the player model, i either joined RedMonster12's world or RedMonster12 joined my world. The world was normal world type and near a tree. RedMonster12 said something about the player model and repeatedly pressed the button for sneak. It looked like they were going up and down because sneaking did not change the pose yet.</p></details>
		Between November 17 and November 23, a filter for the chat was added to the version of MineKhan.
		At this time, it only filtered two words: f___ and st____

		<h3>The website for MineKhan</h3>
		Near December 2021, TNJS (https://replit.com/@tnjs) invited thingmaker to help make a website.
		The idea was to create a website where people could upload MineKhan maps to share and download them.
		It was likely that someone told him to ask thingmaker to help create the website for MineKhan maps.
		So, the website for MineKhan was created by thingmaker and TNJS.
		The first things added were a way to upload maps.
		A few weeks later, push notifications were added.
		Anyone who subscribed would get a notification when a new map was uploaded.
		Images from this time:

		New users near this time: Butter (other usernames: Am_Butter, Sharky), Entity_303, Mrbeast

		In Janurary 2022, an update for redstone had started.
		<details><p>One day while watching do mc bedwars, i thought about redstone and how good it would be to add it to MineKhan. So i started making a redstone simulator until late at night (about 9:30 PM).</p></details>
		After a few days, the server also started to run out of space for users and posts.
		New users: Trexler180 (other usernames: Trexler), Prytor, Kiro_sama, Zenith
		So in Feburary 2022, they were moved to a different place. (r____t db to level db)
		At this time, on Feburary 18, the version of MineKhan was getting very popular and there were many worlds in multiplayer at the same time, so a limit of 5 worlds at the same time was added.
		New users: repeat
		In March 2022, there was an idea to create a wiki for MineKhan on the website for MineKhan.
		So the wiki for MineKhan was created, and it looked really bad at first.
		On April 1, 2022, the redstone update for the version of MineKhan was released and it was updated to 1.0.5.
		<a href="/minekhan/assets/images/panorama/redstone_april-2022.png">image</a>
		On April 14, 2022, thingmaker started to create the first external server for the version of MineKhan, which was called 'Test server'. (https://replit.com/@MineKhan/mkServer)
		External servers were a way to host a world for the version of MineKhan where the world stayed open almost all the time and the world could be controlled with code.
		At first, this external server did not have a world, instead, when joining, it asked for a suggestion for the name.
		Then, on April 18, a world save code was added, and on April 19, portals (teleports to another room) were added.
		The code for external servers was still bad and it was easy to cheat. (flying, getting any item)
		New users in April 2022: shubbleYT, eaglermaster (other usernames: Eaglemasterussr), Fire_Fox, sadlyitsnotme, AXL_SENSEI
		On May 3 2022, whitelist was added to the version of MineKhan and the server.
		Capes and cloud saves for MineKhan were also added.
		<details><summary>mysterious hacks</summary><p>A user who's username was yiff, and also had a previous username that probably contained 'piano' in it, probably appeared on May 5. This user used something that was called 'karmaclient', which was like a bot, to run commands in the version of MineKhan like '.troll username' or '.crash'. Most of the time when he joined, something like these would show: "yiff joined. yiff joined. yiff: [ADMIN] K4RMACLIENT ACTIVATED.". I was in a survival world with normal world type hosted by someone, and he joined with his previous username which contained "piano". He used a command (probably ".kill") when i was in the entrance of a cave, but it did not work because of a bug. Later, I was in a world called "Galdor's castle" which had a castle, then he joined with the username that started with a y, and used the command ".crash". A message appeared that said "CR4SH" and it froze. Another time, I was in a superflat world in multiplayer, then he joined but did not turn on the client that had the commands. I used a command like "/sendeval yiff Messages.write('.troll yiff')", then he said something like "you try to use sendeval on me". Unfortunately, this user disappeared after a few days and i did not find other information.</p></details>
		Video from May 24: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ML3dW2XZThY
		
		Unfortunately, the popularity decreased a lot in the summer, but multiplayer worlds in the version of MineKhan was still common.
		In June 2022, multiplayer in the version of MineKhan stopped working.
		The server for the website for MineKhan ran out of space, which happened faster than normal, and stopped working.
		At this time, thingmaker was away for about a week and did not know about it, and some people thought he couldn't fix it.
		There was a post called 'Admin vote'.
		On June 19, a skybox was added to the version of MineKhan.
		It was a simple gradient that was brighter in the middle.
		On June 25, the code for external servers were moved. (to https://www.npmjs.com/package/minekhan-server)
		On June 27, a room with creative mode was added to the Test server.
		A external server called 'War SMP' was also created.
		On June 28, a lobby was added, then bedwars was added, which had 4 islands and a wait for 4 players and a win when a bed was broken. It was not very good quality because there was flat layer of grass underneath.
		New users: ILikeCheese
		New users near this time: Speedy4, springyeet

		In July 2022, there were many accounts on the server that were unused, so many of these were deleted.
		<details><p>Near this time, after I added the spectate player feature, I joined the war smp to test it. The people already there were probably Briannastar, Alicia_Heart, and Clown_Pierce. I tried spectating one of them. It was moving in a irritating way. There were a few rooms inside a hill, and one had pink wool.</p></details>
		On July 6, a external server called 'Dope SMP' was created, and a thing that ban people when they try to ban.
		On July 27, flowing water and lava was added to the version of MineKhan.
		The flowing water was glitchy in multiplayer because they appeared and disappeared.
		On the last day of July, the users and posts and other things were moved again. (level db to cloud storage)
		New users: HackySacks

		August 2022:
		On August 1, an external server called "Luke's Server" was created, which had a survival anarchy and a game called 'The Pit' where players fight and get to the top of a tower.
		On August 8, claiming chunks was added to the Test server.
		There were more external servers: one by Paragram (forgot name), Epixel, one by RedMonster12.
		Images of 'Test server':

		During August and September, more redstone things were added to the version of MineKhan.
		August 2022, new users: gouling, Raeshawna, Paragram, I, TomMustBe12
		In September 2022, TomMustBe12 started sending emails to thingmaker about making him admin or hacking the version of MineKhan.
		September 2022, new users: Thunder_Wolf, perX, Express
		<details><p>Some time near this, Raeshawna hosted a server called "Raeshawna's survival server", which was a survival server. At the spawn, there was a tree (or/and house) with a chest outside and a sign that sayed that the things in the chest were free. So I did a prank. I made a room under the tree and put a line of hoppers that moved things from the chest to another chest in the room. A while later, I decided to make it move the things to the chest outside. Then, i made a hole with lava inside so that when someone fell in and dropped their items, the items would go to the chest outside. No one really fell in.</p></details>
		On September 7, posts were made to load faster.
		On September 20, the message was added to the server that showed if someone was a admin when they joined a world in the version of MineKhan.
		On September 22, a option for disabling filter for chat was added to the version of MineKhan and the server.
		<details><p>Some time before September 19, sup6666 started using the code that disabled the filter for everyone. <code inline>Messages.remove=[]</code> Some time before September 22, sup6666 started saying #saveminecraft. He also sent messages (message: "f___ 2-people") with the title command that had f words that the filter could not remove. He stopped after the option for disabling the filter was added. He probably did it because a filter was added to MC that many people disliked.</p></details>
    <img src="/assets/images/Screen Shot 2022-09-02 at 8.31.12 PM.jpg" loading="lazy">
		<details><p>From August 31 to September 2, thingmaker made a vc for fun (https://replit.com/@thingMaker/voice-chat). It was bad quality but also had a written chat. Soon, many people started using it.</p></details>

		October 2022:
		On October 2, comments were added to user profiles.
		Later in October, thingmaker decided to combine the website and the server with the new website for MineKhan. (https://replit.com/@minekhan/MineKhan)
		The maps and wiki pages were also moved to the place where the users and posts were.
		The home page of thingmaker's website and the website for MineKhan were also combined, and the website was renamed.
		This was also when TomMustBe12 created the form, 'Admin for MineKhan'. (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/19w9xtnu1rh1NEWQsQ4LErVo2DCyAbUx_I6bO2AmocgE)
		<details><p>Another thing that happened was that Spa<span>mmer17 sayed that they would make the website g</span>one if not give admin. Many things including code and important history were deleted because of this on GH.</p></details>
		<details><p>Around this time, many people wanted admin which was probably because they saw that others were. They probably saw being admin as being better. Many people asked thingmaker for it. Most people stopped asking around Janurary 2023.</p></details>

		After some time, in November 2022, saving previous version of wiki pages was added to the website for MineKhan.
		New users: rayLee
		On November 27, a game mode called 'chaos' was added to the Test server. It was a game mode where lava falls from the sky.
		At the end of November, external servers for MineKhan were updated to be faster by making it connect directly. (it was like that when external servers were first added)

		<datails><summary>Another 'hacked' client</summary><p>In December 2022, TomMustBe12 created something like a plugin that allowed people to cheat. (https://replit.com/@awhatcott/KhaHack) It seemed that only a few people used it.</p></datails>
		December 2022, new users: Micro_Wave, jennanoelhupp
		On December 7, the order of posts was reversed to make the most recent one on top.

		Janurary 2023, new users: Caterpillar_fan, Light_FN, 2bHNSTi (possibly wrong time)
		On Janurary 1, thingmaker thought that TomMustBe12 had stlen programs and code from him, so a message was added that explained it.
		On Janurary 5, a cape was limited to certain people.
		On Janurary 7, the message that showed if someone was a admin was removed.

		Feburary 2023
		<details><p>rayLee sayed that they would <span>take away the website and b<span>an thing</span>maker from the website if not gi</span>ven admin.</p></details>
		On Feburary 3, features.js was added to the version of MineKhan.
		It was a script that had a 1 in 1000 chance of running, that would randomly show the message 'it will be gone' and run randomly generated commands.

		As March 2023 began, the website was about to be moved again because the website started to stop working and R____t's free hosting was going to end in 2024.
		The console of the server was filled messages of socket hang up or something similar.
		At this time, resource packs had also been added to the version of MineKhan.
		Finally, after a month, the website was moved. (to thingmaker.us.eu.org)
		TNJS did not go to the new website.

		<h3>Website change</h3>
		After the website was moved, the website started working again and became faster.
		The website was renamed back to 'My website'.
		At this time, the website popularity had decreased more.
		In April 2023, many things were added to the version MineKhan, including hardcore mode, double sided signs, and more.
		New users: MouseMan (other usernames: MouseMania, MouseManiaAlt), Szable, Maly_Byk (other username like: Peq???Toro), King_kye

		May 2023, new users: CubeX_, Silver_

		In June 2023, more things were added (cherry and bamboo).
		At this time, thingmaker started to create new terrain for the version of MineKhan.
		Many months was used to do this.
		New users: cheezit_sauce, StinkinChicken, incognito, scuffed, MonocleCat

		July 2023, new users: Mythical_Sweetz

		August 2023, new users: likofring_exe

		In October 2023, the version of MineKhan was updated to 1.1.0, and the new terrain was added.
		<a href="/minekhan/assets/images/panorama/beta-1.0.0-oct-29-2023.png">image</a>
		Multiplayer was also changed to make cheating harder.
		New users: sus12
		Many more months were used to improve the terrain in the version of MineKhan because thingmaker did not think it was good enough.

		In March 2024, the version of MineKhan was updated to 1.1.1, which made cheating even harder.
		At this time, There were about 30 users per day. (there may have been more that were not logged in)
		Soon thingmaker's version of MineKhan was discontinued, because the amount of players had decreased a lot.

    <h3>Moving again</h3>
		On July 10, 2024, the website was moved again. (to aaaathing.github.io)
		The website was now static, so the login and posts and MineKhan multiplayer could not be used.

		On August 11 2024, thingmaker started writing the history.
    On August 21 2024, the website was moved and became not static.
    Many people came back but there were still few people.
