{"name":"i/Tree_information","user":"2-people","content":"Patterns of tree growth\n\n<h1>Segments</h1>\nTrees are made of branch segments and other stuff. Each segment comes from buds on previous segments. This means that segments will have more segments on them. The location of the buds depend on branching patterns.\nAlmost all trees have only one branching pattern.\n\n<h1>Branch pattern</h1>\nThere is different branching patterns.\n\n<h2>Alternating</h2>\nAlternating branching rotates by an angle close to 180 degrees, for each bud. Example: level 1 left, level 2 right, level 3 left level 4 right.\n\n<h2>Rotating alternating</h2>\nRotating alternating is like the alternating branching pattern, but every 2 buds, it rotates an additional amount that is close to 90 degrees. Example: level 1 north, level 2 south, level 3 east, level 4 west, level 5 north, level 6 south.\nThis seems to be the most common branching pattern.\nTrees with this include cherry.\n\n<h2>Opposite</h2>\nOpposite branching have branches on opposite sides. Buds are rotated the same way on the same branch segment except for the ones at the end. Example: level 1 left & right, level 2 left & right, level 3 left & right.\nRose has this branching pattern.\n\n<h2>Rotating opposite</h2>\nRotating opposite is like opposite branching pattern, but every 2 buds, it rotates an additional amount that is close to 90 degrees.\n\n<h1>Imperfection</h1>\nBranches and buds can fall off a tree.\nBuds can also not grow the next year and get delayed for multiple years. This causes trees to not look perfect and causes different sized branches.\nBecause each branch segment does not point in the same direction, branches can look like a helix or zig-zag.\n\n<h1>Leaf</h1>\nAt the end of alternating branch, there is one bud in the same direction as the branch.\nAt the end of opposite branching branch, there is two buds facing away from each other.\nBuds and leaves grow together in same place and follow the same pattern.\n\n<h1>Flower</h1>\nFlowers go at end of branch segment for certain trees, or at the side. They replace leaves and buds.\nThe flower branches have same branching pattern and fall off after a while.","pwd":"","created":1716060688111,"previous":["H4sIAAAAAAAAAyvPSCxRSM9PLVbISC1Ktbe3BwC/gJZKEQAAAA=="],"comments":[{"user":"Caterpillar_fan","content":"Wait wut?","created":1716428814933,"id":"lwiledsl4gfd"},{"user":"cheezit_sauce","content":"woah cool. this is interesting","created":1716669586860,"id":"lwmkqylogwoz"}]}
